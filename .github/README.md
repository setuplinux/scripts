# Scripts Repository

This repo holds personal-lab helper scripts. Highlights:

- `cluster_tui.py`: curses-based cluster health + repair TUI. Title shows `Cluster TUI vYYYY.MM.DD | Log: /full/path/cluster_tui-YYYYMMDD.log`, and a tutorial sidebar lists the SSH commands each action runs so you can copy/paste them into notes or GitHub issues.
- `upterm-2404-installer.sh`: fetch/install the latest Upterm release on Ubuntu 24.04+ automatically.

See the root `README.md` for usage walkthroughs, publishing checklist, and the commands to verify file paths/timestamps before pushing updates.
